### collection of math and computer science handouts, lecture notes, paper readings, and more

This is a collection of TeX-based handouts and compact lecture notes
from papers that I have read and presented.  The collection is closely
related to my [cheat sheet collection](https://github.com/bohm/cheats/); however, the usefulness of the handouts may be limited to
those who attended the same lecture or wish to study a specific paper.


The handouts were created during my student life at the Charles
University in Prague, where I am currently enrolled as a PhD student
in Computer Science, specializing on approximation and online
algorithms. If you have any handouts of yours that you would like to
include in this collection, I would be happy to incorporate them.

All handouts are written in English. The PDF files are hosted at my
university page, and will be linked below.
